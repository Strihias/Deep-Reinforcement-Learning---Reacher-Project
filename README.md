# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning---Continuous Control - Reacher

This project is completed as a part of the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893 "Google's Homepage") from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). 

## Getting Started 
### Installation requirements

1. You first need to configure a Python 3.6 / PyTorch 0.4.0 environment. You can find an in depth guide in [Udacity space](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies). In order to activate the environment, please follow the [instructions in the DRLND Github repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies). By following these instructions, you will install PyTorch, the ML-Agents toolkit and a few more Python packages required for this project. 

2. Download Unity Environment 

Version 1: One (1) Agent
* Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux.zip)
* Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher.app.zip)
* Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
* Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)

Version 2: Twenty (20) Agents
* Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux.zip)
* Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher.app.zip)
* Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
* Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)

Then, place the file in the p2_continuous-control/ folder in the DRLND GitHub repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file.


3. Explore the environment
Open [Continuous_Control.ipynb ](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/p2_continuous_control) and follow the instructions to learn how to use the Python API to control the agent.
